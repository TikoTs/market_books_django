This is a django project, where you can create a superuser, create new books and make some actions on them. 
I used bootstrap for designing some pages. 
Before using the project, you have to run the commands in terminal:
python manage.py migrate;
python manage.py createsuperuser;
python manage.py runserver.
After that, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin where you will log in and then you can add new books. 
To see the list of books directly, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/store and then click on see details to see more detailed info of the desired book.
